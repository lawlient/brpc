# Default File Config

## Target

Since gflags is not good at complex data structure.

The target of this module is supplying a default config file for each service.

## Principle

Protobuf can parse config file with json or text.

Since json is formatted style, it means more charactor is needed.

Text style is more concise, better than json.
